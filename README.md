# Assembler
        An assembler is a software tool or program that translates assembly 
        language code into machine code, which can be directly executed by 
        a computer's processor. It plays a vital role in the development of
        low-level software and system programming, as it bridges the gap 
        between human-readable assembly instructions and the binary
         representations understood by the hardware.

        Assembly language is a low-level programming language that closely 
        corresponds to the machine language instructions of a specific 
        computer architecture. It uses mnemonic codes to represent individual 
        instructions, memory addresses, and data operands. Assembly language 
        provides a more human-readable and manageable alternative to working 
        directly with binary machine code.

        The assembler reads the assembly code, processes each instruction, 
        and generates the corresponding machine code

# 2. Introduction
        The Assembler program is designed to convert assembly language instructions into 
        machine code that can be executed by a computer. It follows a simple and straightforward
        approach, translating each assembly instruction into its binary representation.

        The program is written in Python, which provides a high-level and easy-to-understand
        syntax, making it suitable for educational purposes or small-scale projects.

# 3. Prerequisites
        To run this Assembler program, you need to have the following software installed on your system:

        Python (version 3.6 or higher)

# 4. Usage
        (i) Clone the repository or download the source code files.
        (ii) Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the program's directory.
        (iii) Run the program using the following command:
```python
                python assembler.py
```
        (iv)The program will read the assembly code from the terminal, assemble
        it, and print the output on the terminal.

# 5. Supported Instructions
        The Assembler program supports a subset of assembly instructions. 
        
        Here is a list of the supported instructions:
        LOAD - Load a value into a register
        STORE - Store a value from a register into memory
        ADD - Add two values and store the result in a register
        SUB - Subtract one value from another and store the result in a register
        MULT - Multiply two values and store the result in a register
        DIV - Divide one value by another and store the result in a register
        MOV Imm - Performs reg1 = $Imm where Imm is a 7 bit value.
        MOV REG - Move content of reg2 into reg1.
        CMP - Compares reg1 and reg2 and sets up the FLAGS register.
        JUMP - Unconditionally jump to a specific memory address
        JUMPEQ - Jump to a specific memory address if two values are equal
        JUMPLT - Jump to a specific memory address if one value is less than another
        JUMPGT - Jump to a specific memory address if one value is greater than another
        LEFT SHIFT - Left shifts reg1 by $Imm, where $Imm is a 7 bit value.
        RIGHT SHIFT - Right shifts reg1 by $Imm, where $Imm is a 7 bit value.
        XOR - Performs bitwise XOR of reg2 and reg3. Stores the result in reg1.
        OR - Performs bitwise OR of reg2 and reg3. Stores the result in reg1.
        AND - Performs bitwise AND of reg2 and reg3. Stores the result in reg1.
        Invert - Performs bitwise NOT of reg2. Stores the result in reg1.
        HALT - Stops the machine from executing until reset.
